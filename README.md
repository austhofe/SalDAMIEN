## About The Project

This is a GitHub repository for a research project with the following Aim:
**Assess how amplification influences the survivability, transmission, and virulence of Salmonella under different environmental conditions using shotgun metagenomics data.** From 2019–2021, the Cooper lab conducted a longitudinal study using shotgun metagenomics to study the survival and mutation rates of _Salmonella_ in soil and irrigation water under different environmental conditions. This project will analyze shotgun metagenomic samples (n=242) to understand mutational rate changes. I hypothesize that Salmonella survives longer with higher humidity and soil moisture, with the amplification step influencing its transmission potential and virulence. These findings will fill a gap in our knowledge about the way Salmonella is transmitted through environmental-exposure pathways.

All data and code for this research project will be made available via this compendium and associated NCBI database project. Instructions for collecting data, as well as code for merging and linking data are available to help others reproduce the results and conduct this work in other areas.
